					<p>I’m a pre-med student studying Computer Science & Biology with Honors at Northeastern University! <br></br>
					This semester, I’m living in Boston with my epic roommates while tackling this unique fall term. 
					Besides classes, I’m volunteering, running a lot, and building 
					<a href="../projects/projects.html#projects">projects</a> like this website!<br></br>
					I'm currently searching for a co-op in Spring of 2021 (Jan - Aug). I'm excited to bring what I've learned
					in classes and through my own projects into the real, professional world! Full-stack software development,
					bioinformatics, and healthcare/medicine are my current areas of interest.<br></br>
					Random fun fact: I got some paint-by-numbers kits recently and I love them! I'd never painted before in my
					life. They're relaxing and rewarding at the same time, which is hard to find.

					<h4>Northeastern University <em>Class of 2023</em></h4>
					<p>I am currently in my second year at Northeastern, working towards my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Biology degree. This semester I’m taking Organic Chemistry 2, Algorithms, 
					Physics 2, and Probability & Statistics.<br></br>
					I love my time at Northeastern University so far! I have met many friends that continually support each other and mentors that excel at teaching and challenging my boundaries.</p>

					<h4>Endurance Running</h4>
					<p>I’ve been running for about seven years now and I truly love it! It’s such a pure sport with a low barrier of entry, and as such has a great community everywhere I go. 
					Running teaches a lesson with every step and is a good escape from the desk and my worries.<br></br>
					Most recently, I was training for my first marathon in March, hoping to qualify for the Boston Marathon. Although those plans were instantly dissolved by the pandemic, I 
					still run weekly. Hopefully 2021 will be kinder!</p>

					<h4>The Outdoors</h4>
					<p>There’s just something so relaxing about going outside, especially when it comes with awesome views! Hiking someplace and taking in nature along the way sometimes is a great 
					“detox” from the city. Although my recent adventuring has been somewhat limited because of classes, not having a car, and the pandemic, I always look forward to getting outside 
					somewhere new!<br></br>
					This photo is from a hike with the Northeastern University Hus-Skiers and Outing Club in the White Mountains. It was a foggy and somewhat dreary day, but a beautiful hike nonetheless.</p>

					<h4>Music</h4>
					<p>Playing the piano has been a long-time hobby of mine! I recently picked it up again after a year-long hiatus because college got too busy. I’m still rusty and relearning songs, but am enjoying 
					every minute of practice. It’s calming yet rewarding, which is a perfect and elusive combo.<br></br>
					I also love listening to music ranging across several genres. One of my favorite artists I’ve found lately is ANIMA!, and the most controversial is 100 Gecs (for the record, I think they’re pretty cool).</p>
